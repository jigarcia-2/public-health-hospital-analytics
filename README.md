### Public Health Hospital Analytics
#### Context
This project was developed as part of the MSc in Data Science (ITBA),
within the course "Data Warehouses and OLAP".

The original documentation and presentation were delivered in Spanish,
as required by the academic program.

#### My Role
- Database modeling (conceptual, logical and physical design)
- SQL analytical queries for productivity, absenteeism and cost recovery
- OLAP-oriented analysis for healthcare decision-making

#### Data Privacy

This project was developed using real healthcare data.
Due to ethical and legal restrictions, the original datasets are not included
in this repository, as they contain sensitive patient information.

The repository focuses on database design, analytical queries and OLAP logic,
which can be reproduced using anonymized or simulated data.
